## Features ‚ú®

1. **User Authentication & Security**
   - **Secure Registration/Login:** Uses [`werkzeug.security`](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/) for password hashing.
   - **Session Management:** Implements [`flask-session`](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Session/) for secure, server-side session storage.
   - **Input Validation:** Employs [`email-validator`](https://pypi.org/project/email-validator/) for emails and [`phonenumbers`](https://pypi.org/project/phonenumbers/) for phone numbers.

2. **Dynamic Menu Management**
   - **Add/Remove Items:** Organize menu items into 9 categories (e.g., "Espresso Bar", "Desserts").
   - **Price Management:** Input and display prices with consistent formatting.
   - **Real-Time Editing:** Provides instant updates to the menu during creation.

3. **Theme Customization**
   - **Three Unique Styles:**
     - **Colorful:** Bold colors and playful fonts for a lively vibe.
     - **Illustrational:** Soft pastels and hand-drawn aesthetics.
     - **Minimalistic:** Clean lines and monochromatic tones for modern elegance.
   - **Dynamic Previews:** Renders menus with theme-specific colors, fonts, and background images.

4. **Subscription & Contact Systems**
   - **Newsletter Subscription:** Allows coffee shop owners to subscribe for updates on new features and themes.
   - **Interactive Contact Form:** A dynamic form at `/contact` for inquiries or feedback, with validation ensuring email correctness and message completeness.

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-friendly templates ensure menus look great on all devices.

## File Structure & Key Components üìÇ

1. **app.py (Core Application)**
   - **Routes:** Handles all HTTP requests (e.g., `/login`, `/add`, `/menu`, `/contact`).
   - **Session Management:** Uses `flask-session` to track logged-in users.
   - **Database Interactions:** Utilizes SQLite alongside the [CS50 Library](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/) to simplify SQL queries.
   - **Security:** Validates inputs, hashes passwords, and sanitizes user data.

2. **helpers.py (Decorators)**
   - **@login_required:** Restricts access to authenticated users only. Redirects unauthorized users to `/login`.

3. **Templates (HTML)**
   - **layout.html:**
     - Serves as the base template inherited by all other pages to ensure consistent styling.
     - Includes a navigation bar, CSS/JS links, and dynamic content blocks (`{% block content %}`).
     - Dynamically displays login/logout links based on the user session.
   - **login.html / register.html:** Manage user authentication with real-time error feedback.
   - **add.html / remove.html:** Provide forms for managing menu items.
   - **menu.html:** Offers a style selection page with theme previews.
   - **display_menu.html:** Dynamically renders the final menu with the chosen styling.
   - **contact.html:** Collects user emails and messages, validates inputs, and submits data to the database.
   - **about.html:** A static page describing the web application.

4. **Static Files (CSS/Images)**
   - **styles.css:** Centralizes styling to maintain consistency across all pages.
   - **Theme Images:** Includes background images (e.g., `img_1.jpg`) tied to specific styles.

5. **Database (coffeeshops.db)**
   - **Tables:**
     - `users`: Stores coffee shop credentials and details.
     - `menu`: Tracks menu items linked to users via `user_id`.
     - `subscribers`/`contact`: Manages newsletter subscriptions and support inquiries.

## Design Choices & Debates ü§î

1. **Template Inheritance with layout.html**
   - **Rationale:** Centralizes shared HTML/CSS (e.g., navigation bars, headers) to avoid redundancy and ensure a consistent UI across all pages.
   - **Debate:** Although separate headers per page were considered, inheritance was chosen to simplify maintenance.

2. **Session Management Over Cookies**
   - **Rationale:** By using `flask-session` with server-side storage, session data remains secure and tamper-proof compared to Flask‚Äôs default signed cookies.

3. **Database Choice: SQLite**
   - **Rationale:** SQLite is lightweight, serverless, and ideal for small applications. It offers simplicity and ease of setup without the overhead of a full-fledged database server.

4. **Theme Implementation**
   - **Debate:** Full customization of colors/fonts was initially considered. Limiting choices to three cohesive themes ensures professional results and reduces decision fatigue.
   - **Compromise:** Themes include predefined fonts (e.g., `shrikhand-regular`) and color palettes, with plans for future expansion via CSS variables.
